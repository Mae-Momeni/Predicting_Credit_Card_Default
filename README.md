# Project: Predicting Credit Card Default 
**This project is a classifier to predict if a customer will pay the credit card or default to pay**<br>
<br>
The summary of the project is as follows:<br>
•	A classifier to predict if a customer will default the credit card payment<br>
•	Reached 87% “recall” as the business metric using hyperparameter tunning<br>
•	Reduced inference time by 15% by dropping the least important features using Random Forest<br>
•	Prepared data pipeline (reading data, cleaning data, applying ML model, returning results)<br>
•	Implemented utils functions for frequent tasks such as data pre-processing, data-cleaning, visualizations, etc<br>
•	Applied statistical power analysis to evaluate if we need more data
